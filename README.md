      		<li>Verify your email.</li>
		    <li>Log into your new Github account.</li>
    	</ol>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Step 2: Create a new repository in Github</h2>

      		<li>In Github click on the “New” or “+” button on the screen.</li>
      		<li>Fill out the form: name of repository, description, and private/public.</li>
      		<li>Then click on create Repository.</li>
    	</ol>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Step 3: Clone the repository in VS</h2>
	    <ol>
      		<li>If you haven't done so yet, download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Code Studio</a></li>
            <li>Make sure you are using the same account for Github and VS.</li>
            <li>Copy the URL of the repository on Github.</li>
      		<li>Find the option to clone the repository on VS.</li>
      		<li>Place the URL and clone the repository.</li>
    	</ol>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Step 4: Commit Changes from VS to Github</h2>

    <h3>In case an error should appear when attempting to commit changes:</h3>

    <h4>Additional intrustions: If needed follow these steps in the terminal:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>use the command: 'git config --global user.name "Your Name" ' in order to update your name.</li>
            <li>use the command: 'git config --global user.email "YourEmail.com" ' in order to update your email.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Keep in mind you should be using the same user and email from the configuration of Github and VS.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>If you wish to make a new branch in Github:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>At the top left of the repository menu, find and click on the option of Branch.</li>
            <li>Click on the option to create a new branch and give it a proper name.</li>
            <li>Once created, you should be now viewing the new branch and be able to make the desired changes.</li>
        </ol>
    <br></br>

            <li>Click on "New Pull Request".</li>
            <li>Select the branches that are going to be on the request (merged).</li>
            <li>Review the changes that will be made for the merging.</li>
